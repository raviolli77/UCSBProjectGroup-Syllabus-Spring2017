# Spring Quarter Project Group - Data Science at UCSB
## Week 5: Project Iterations

**Preliminaries**:

+ Does your team have a *virtual environment* set up?
+ Does your team have a repo for your project?
	+ Does it have a pretty **README**?
	+ Branches for each teammate?

## Project Iterations
Needed by the end of today:
+ requirements.txt
+ Clear project goal on repo
+ fork repo unto [Organizational Repo](https://github.com/UCSB-dataScience-ProjectGroup)

**NOTE**: If you ask me something and I tell you to send me message through *Slack*. Do it. 

## Understand Git Workflow
Read documentation relating to *git* and the workflow involved. 

Choose between *git* and the *GitHub* Desktop App. 

Choose between a script or notebook (or have two people in your team either or)

Read [inertia7](https://www.inertia7.com/) for documentation relating to questions for any of these issues. Ask questions, a lot of them.
